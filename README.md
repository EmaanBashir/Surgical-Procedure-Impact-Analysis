# Analyze-impact-of-a-new-surgical-procedure
The aim of this analysis is to investigate the impact of a new surgical procedure on the length of 
hospital stays following heart surgery. We will address the following research questions:
1. Does the data from the new surgical procedure support the hypothesis that the new surgical 
procedure reduces the mean length of hospital stays?
2. Using a Matched Case-Control study, assess the size of reduction in the length of hospital 
stay due to the new surgical procedure.
